# platesDetection
This project applies a sequence of computer vision techniques to detect and extract license plate numbers from images. It uses grayscale conversion to simplify data, Gaussian blur to suppress background noise and highlight prominent characters, Canny edge detection to outline the plate number, and EasyOCR to read the plate number
